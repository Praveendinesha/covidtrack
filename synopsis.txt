Dataset for COVID-19 Tracking in the United States

This dataset contains COVID-19 tracking information for the United States. 
The scope of this tracking dataset is not limited to a specific objective; 
rather, it records how patients have been affected, the number of fatalities, and those who have recovered. 
There is no clear target variable in this tracking dataset, making it an INDEPENDENT DATASET. 
Consequently, we classify it as an UNSUPERVISED, REGRESSION DATASET.
