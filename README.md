**Machine learning basic terms / The U.S Covid Tracking Dataset**

*Dataset for COVID-19 Tracking in the United States*

This dataset contains COVID-19 tracking information for the United States.
The scope of this tracking dataset is not limited to a specific objective; rather, it records how patients have been affected, the number of fatalities, 
and those who have recovered. There is no clear target variable in this tracking dataset, making it an **Independent Dataset.**
Consequently, we classify it as an **Unsupervised, Regression Dataset.**
